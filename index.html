<h2>Analysis of Movie Trends in Relation to Historical Events</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Middle East (Post-2004)</strong>: The rise in films related to the Middle East after the Iraq War likely reflects Hollywoodâ€™s reaction to the growing geopolitical and military presence in the region, shaping cultural perceptions.</li>

  <li><strong>Nazi (1940s and 1960s-70s)</strong>: The surge in Nazi-related films during the 1940s coincides with World War II. A second wave in the 1960s and 70s likely stems from Cold War tensions, as filmmakers revisited themes of authoritarianism and totalitarian regimes.</li>

  <li><strong>Vietnam (1960s-80s)</strong>: The two peaks in Vietnam-related films illustrate the immediate cultural response to the war in the 1960s and 1970s, followed by a critical reappraisal of its impact on American society in the 1980s.</li>
