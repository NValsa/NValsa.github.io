        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        
        <p>
          The story begins with a captivating exploration of cinematic history through a dataset provided by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/" target="_blank">Movie Summary Corpus</a> published in 2013. Movies have always been a mirror of society, reflecting the complexities of their times. Through this article, we aim to uncover how trends in plots and characters reflect historical events.

          An analysis of the <a href="#introduction_dataset_exploration">total number of movies 
            released by country</a> highlights the overwhelming dominance of the United States, which accounts for 42.04 % of the database. This inspired us to focus primarily on U.S. cinema, which serves as a rich lens through which we explore three compelling themes: <a href="#part1"><strong>war</strong></a>, <a href="#part2"><strong>social changes</strong></ahref></a>, and <a href="#part3"><strong>economic struggle</strong></a>. These themes unravel the narratives that have shaped history and continue to influence our understanding of it.
        </p>
        
        <h3>The Initial Vision: A Tale of Two Rivals</h3>
        
        <p>
          Originally, our analysis aimed to compare American movies with those from Russia, driven by the long-standing rivalry between the two nations. This rivalry, steeped in decades of proxy wars, economic and political differences, and iconic historical moments—such as the <strong>Cold War</strong>, the <strong>Space Race</strong>, and the <strong>fall of the Berlin Wall</strong>—offered a unique opportunity to explore contrasting cinematic perspectives.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The timeline of significant events in the U.S.-Russia relationship aligns closely with the period covered by the dataset. This seemed to provide a fertile ground for comparative analysis. However, this ambition was met with a challenge: <strong>dataset bias.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why Focus Solely on American Movies?</h3>
        
        <p>
          While comparing the two nations’ cinemas was an exciting proposition, the dataset proved to be heavily biased. U.S. cinema dominates the corpus in terms of quantity, diversity, and completeness of data, making any meaningful comparison with Russian films difficult. This lack of balance between the two sides of the rivalry hindered our ability to draw fair and comprehensive conclusions.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result, we decided to shift our focus entirely to American cinema. However, we will still examine the <strong>bipolar perspective of the Cold War</strong> through the lens of U.S. cinema, which often reflects the ideological struggles of the time. For example, the <strong>Vietnam War</strong>, a defining event of the bipolar conflict, will be analyzed from the U.S. point of view. This approach allows us to understand how American cinema portrayed the geopolitical tensions and ideological divides of the era.

            <h2>Movies Produced in the USA Over Time</h2>
            <p>
                As we dive into the analysis of trends in American cinema, it's essential to start with a general overview of movie production over time. A graph showcasing the number of movies produced in the USA across decades provides a clear picture of the evolution of the American film industry.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Observations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Early Growth (Pre-1940s):</strong> 
                    The initial surge in movie production aligns with Hollywood's rise as the global hub of filmmaking, establishing the USA as a leader in the industry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Golden Age (1940s-1960s):</strong> 
                    A steady production level marked by iconic genres such as westerns, musicals, and noir defined this period.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Modern Expansion (Post-1970s):</strong> 
                    A noticeable increase in production reflects technological advancements, globalization, and the diversification of genres.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
        </section>
        
        <p>
          Through this narrowed focus, we hope to provide a nuanced understanding of American cinema’s response to historical events, social changes, and economic challenges. By concentrating on this rich dataset, our project delves into the narratives that have shaped history and offers insights into the interplay between film and society.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Stay tuned as we explore these themes further in our analysis, highlighting the power of cinema as both a storyteller and a historical archive.

            <h2>Collaboration in Movies Between the USA and other Countries</h2>
            <p>
                An interesting dimension of our analysis lies in exploring international collaborations in filmmaking. To visualize this, we created a heat map that displays the normalized fraction of movies co-produced by the USA with other countries over time, using time bins of 10 years. This heat map provides a unique lens to examine how historical and geopolitical contexts influence cinematic partnerships.

            <h3>Key Observations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Collaborations with Allies:</strong>
                    The USA has consistently collaborated with countries such as 
                    <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong>, and the 
                    <strong>United Kingdom</strong> over the decades. These collaborations reflect long-standing cultural and political alliances, especially in the aftermath of WWII and during the Cold War era.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rivals Avoided:</strong>
                    Unsurprisingly, the USA has had no significant cinematic collaborations with its key geopolitical rivals, 
                    <strong>Russia</strong> and <strong>China</strong>. This aligns with historical tensions stemming from the Cold War, ideological differences, and trade barriers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Japan: A Unique Case:</strong>
                    Japan stands out as a country where collaboration trends evolve over time. After WWII, Japan gradually opened up to the USA, leading to an increase in cinematic partnerships. This mirrors Japan’s broader post-war economic and cultural integration with Western powers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Global Influence:</strong>
                    The USA's dominance in cinema is reflected in its ability to engage in numerous partnerships worldwide, albeit selectively. This pattern underscores how soft power operates in shaping international relationships, with cinema serving as a cultural bridge—or boundary—depending on the geopolitical landscape.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The heat map thus offers a visual narrative of how cinema intertwines with diplomacy and global relations, spotlighting patterns of collaboration and exclusion shaped by historical context.
