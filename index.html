    <h2>Part 1: War</h2>
    <section id="part1_6_nations">
        <p>
            In this section we will see the trend of war movies in different
            countries.

        <p>
            Here we will look at the keywords present in the summaries of movies
            and correlate them with historical events.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Middle East (Post-2004)</strong>: The rise in films related to
                    the Middle East after the Iraq War likely reflects Hollywoodâ€™s reaction
                    to the growing geopolitical and military presence in the region, shaping
                    cultural perceptions.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Nazi (1940s and 1960s-70s)</strong>: The surge in Nazi-related
                    films during the 1940s coincides with World War II. A second wave in the
                    1960s and 70s likely stems from Cold War tensions, as filmmakers
                    revisited themes of authoritarianism and totalitarian regimes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Vietnam (1960s-80s)</strong>: The two peaks in Vietnam-related
                    films illustrate the immediate cultural response to the war in the 1960s
                    and 1970s, followed by a critical reappraisal of its impact on American
                    society in the 1980s.
